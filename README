	When run, this application will listen on the IP address and port defined
	near the top of the application source code in the address and port
	variables.  Default values are an address of 127.0.0.1 and port 5000.
	
	The application will respond to HTTP "GET" requests to the following paths,
	returning the specified data:
	
	Path: /games
	Data: JSON output of the top metacritic scores of playstation 3 games,
	along with their titles.
	
	Path: /games/<GAME>
	Data: JSON output of the title and score of <GAME> for playstation 3
	
	Path: /PS4games
	Data: JSON output of the top metacritic scores of playstation 4 games,
	along with their titles.
	
	Path: /PS4games/<GAME>
	Data: JSON output of the title and score of <GAME> for playstation 4
	
	NOTES: The page being parsed only shows scores from the last 90 days,
	and the top ten games for that period.  Scores for individual games that
	are not in the top 10, or scored more than 90 days ago, cannot be retrieved.
	
	If there are less than 10 titles with scores within the last 90 days, the
	bulk output may return fewer than 10 results.
